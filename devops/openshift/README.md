# RedHat OpenShift on Microsoft Azure

This template deploys **RedHat OpenShift**. OpenShift is an open and extensible container application platform that brings Docker and Kubernetes to the enterprise.
OpenShift includes Kubernetes for container orchestration and management. It adds developer- and operations-centric tools that enable:

- Rapid application development.
- Easy deployment and scaling.
- Long-term lifecycle maintenance for teams and applications.

There are multiple versions of OpenShift, of which the two below are available to run in Azure:

- OpenShift Origin
- OpenShift Container Platform

## OpenShift Origin

Origin is an open-source upstream project of OpenShift that's community supported. Origin can be installed on CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

## OpenShift Container Platform

Container Platform is an enterprise-ready commercial version from and supported by Red Hat. With this version, customers purchase the necessary entitlements for OpenShift Container Platform and are responsible for installation and management of the entire infrastructure.

Because customers "own" the entire platform, they can install it in their on-premises datacenter, or in a public cloud (such as Azure, AWS, or Google).

For quick demo, you can also run OpenShift Test Drive. This provisions a temporary (4 hours) environment that doesn't need a subscription.
